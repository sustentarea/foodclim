## Overview

`FoodClim` is a [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) model for simulating and visualizing how food yield responds to different climate conditions. It is designed to support empirically grounded agent-based models on food systems and to improve the reproducibility of simulations by enabling [parallel execution](#integrating-with-other-models) alongside other models.

The model runs in parallel with the [`LogoClim`](https://github.com/sustentarea/logoclim) model, which provides climate data from [WorldClim 2.1](https://worldclim.org/).

## How to Use It

Refer to the [`LogoClim`](https://github.com/sustentarea/logoclim) installation guide for detailed steps on installing the required dependencies.

Once `LogoClim` is installed, you can run the `FoodClim` model by specifying the path to your `LogoClim` installation in the `FoodClim` interface. This allows `FoodClim` to access climate data provided by `LogoClim` during simulations.

Refer to the `Info` tab in the model for additional details.

### Integrating with Other Models

`FoodClim` can be integrated with other models using the [LevelSpace](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/ls.html) (`ls`) extension for NetLogo. LevelSpace enables parallel execution and communication between multiple models. This approach supports more comprehensive simulations and facilitates the study of complex interactions between food systems and environmental processes.
