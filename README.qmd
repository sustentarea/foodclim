## Overview

`FoodClim` is a [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) model designed to simulate how food yield responds to different climate conditions. It aims to support empirically-based agent-based on food systems and enhance the reproducibility of their simulations.

The model runs in paralel with the [`LogoClim`](https://github.com/sustentarea/logoclim) model, which provides climate data from [WorldClim 2.1](https://worldclim.org/).

## How to Use It

Refer to the [`LogoClim`](https://github.com/sustentarea/logoclim) installation guide for detailed steps on installing the required dependencies.

Once `LogoClim` is installed, you can run the `FoodClim` model by specifying the path to your `LogoClim` installation in the `FoodClim` interface. This allows `FoodClim` to access climate data provided by `LogoClim` during simulations.

Refer to the `Info` tab in the model for additional details.
