## Overview

`rice` is a NetLogo model designed to simulate and visualize the
response of rice under different climate conditions. Its primary goal is
to facilitate the integration of food agents into agent-based models and
enhance the reproducibility of these simulations.

The model runs in paralel with the
[`LogoClim`](https://github.com/sustentarea/logoclim) model, which
provides climate data from [WorldClim 2.1](https://worldclim.org/).
